The Dicee Challenge. Section 17 of The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp Udemy course with Dr. Angela Yu. 

The Dicee Challenge, as presented in Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course, is a simple web-based dice rolling game. Here's a concise description of how to "play" it, keeping in mind it's more of a coding exercise than a complex game:

Game Objective:

The goal is to create a web page that simulates rolling two dice and visually displays the results, declaring which "player" wins (or if it's a draw).
Gameplay:

Roll the Dice:
The web page, when loaded or refreshed, automatically generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of two dice.
Display Results:
The page displays the corresponding dice images for each generated number.
The page also displays a text result, indicating:
"Player 1 Wins!" if the first die's value is higher.
"Player 2 Wins!" if the second die's value is higher.
"Draw!" if both dice have the same value.
"Replay":
To "play" again, the user simply refreshes the web page or pressing the roll dice button, triggering a new dice roll.
Essentially:

It's a visual representation of a single dice roll comparison, designed to teach basic JavaScript concepts like random number generation and DOM manipulation.
